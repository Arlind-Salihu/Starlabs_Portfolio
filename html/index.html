          I am a front-end web developer. 
          I like creative and modern website design as an experienced front-end developer. 
          I prefer high code quality in web development as an experienced web developer. 
          I am experienced in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS, Vue JS, PHP, Laravel, MySQL, 
          ASP .NET Core, Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator. 
          After establishing a shared vision and clear scope, I use the process of rapid 
          iteration to work with a client developing an initial concept into a polished product.
          I love delivering projects to clients that we can both be proud of.
